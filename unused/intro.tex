\section{Introduction}

The KÃ¶nigsberg bridge problem, which was posed and answered in the negative by Euler in
1736 represents the beginning of graph theory~\cite{euler}. Graph is a generic data structure and is a
superset of lists, and trees. Binary search on sorted lists can be interpreted as a balanced
binary tree search. Database tables can be thought of as indexed lists, and table joins
represent relations between columns. This can be modeled as graphs instead. Assignment
of registers to variables (by compiler), and assignment of available channels to a radio
transmitter and also graph problems. Finding shortest path between two points, and
sorting web pages in order of importance are also graphs problems. Neural networks are
graphs too. Interaction between messenger molecules in the body, and interaction between
people on social media, also modeled as graphs.
